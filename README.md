A big, modern, blocky affair with a mobile-style menu, fully responsive styling,
and an assortment of pre-styled elements. So, pretty much what you were expecting
-- except, of course, for how it's put together, specifically:

- It's built with components from my Responsive Tools project.

- It uses flexbox, which eliminates all kinds of terrible hacks and clunky layout
  stopgaps (like CSS grid systems).

- It uses Sass* a lot more intelligently, thanks in part to several new mixins
  and functions I've been working on (as well as a few by @HugoGiraudel).

  (* = still entirely optional if you prefer vanilla CSS :)

- A ton of other stuff.

In short, Spectral's the culmination of several new things I'm working on/trying out,
so please, let me know what you think :)
